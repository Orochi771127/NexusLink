# Nexus Link Cross-AI Execution Ledger

## Purpose

This is the single operational handoff record for every collaborating AI.
It is not product canon, a substitute for code review, or a release approval.
The Master Canon, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `ACCEPTANCE.md` remain higher
authority documents.

Use this ledger to answer four questions without reconstructing history from
chat transcripts or unrelated Git commits:

1. What is currently implemented in this worktree?
2. What was verified, on which branch and commit?
3. What problems, risks, or blockers remain?
4. What is the next safe action for the next AI?

## Mandatory Protocol

Before starting a TASK_PACK:

1. Read the latest entry in the relevant lane.
2. Read every document named in that entry's `Required reading` field.
3. Treat remote-branch evidence as unintegrated until the current `HEAD` or
   checked-out worktree proves otherwise.

Before completing a TASK_PACK or reporting a blocker:

1. Append a new entry to each affected lane. Do not delete historical entries.
2. Record work performed, verification, problems, and the next safe action.
3. State the branch and commit. Do not claim runtime integration from a design
   document, a remote branch, or an unverified test report.
4. Link only the relevant files. Do not mix engineering status, art status,
   and Raphael status into a single ambiguous entry.

For a long-running task, append an `IN PROGRESS` entry before editing. For a
short task, one final `VERIFIED`, `COMPLETED`, or `BLOCKED` entry is enough.

Allowed status values: `PLANNED`, `IN PROGRESS`, `VERIFIED`, `COMPLETED`,
`BLOCKED`, `SUPERSEDED`.

## Entry Template

## Lane 1 - Game Engineering And Architecture

### 2026-06-25 - Codex - P0-B Pixi focal-zone root-bounds fix

- Status: `VERIFIED`
- Branch / commit: `integrate/ui-v2-raphael-main` / `fd5d8eb` base, uncommitted P0-B fix
- Scope: Root-bounds sizing, first-paint companion animation loading, and companion focal-zone visibility. No state, asset, Raphael, or UI-controller changes.
- Work performed: Made `#game-root` bounds authoritative when non-zero, retried root measurement after initial layout, observed root resizes where the browser supports it, and reduced first-paint animation loading to visible idle/sleep frames before warming the remaining core pack.
- Verification: `git diff --check`; bundled Node syntax checks for all UI and Pixi modules; local HTTP server on port 8765; fresh-origin browser checks at 390×844, 393×852, 430×932, and 1280×800. Each had one canvas and matching root/canvas CSS dimensions. Visual checks confirmed the live Pixi greyshade cat in the focal zone at 390×844 and desktop; console errors were zero.
- Problems / risks: The in-app browser's clipboard bridge prevented a repeated browser text injection. The unchanged typed/quick-reply Raphael behavior was verified in the prior UI pack and by the deterministic Raphael smoke/dialogue harness in this task. Full cross-device human QA remains separate.
- Next safe action: Review and commit this bounded P0-B diff, then run the first-habitat cross-device QA evidence package.
- Required reading: `AGENTS.md`, `ACCEPTANCE.md`, `docs/dev/LOCAL_PREVIEW.md`, `src/pixi/pixiApp.js`, and `src/pixi/companionRenderer.js`.

### 2026-06-24 - Codex - Runtime baseline and remediation audit

- Status: `VERIFIED`
- Branch / commit: `codex/ui-v2-aurora-parity` / `4c65a40` for the audit record
- Scope: Current root vanilla JS and PixiJS runtime; no runtime patch was made.
- Work performed: Recorded Aurora B UI completion and inspected the first-habitat
  runtime against the current Master Canon.
- Verification: The audit records JavaScript syntax checks, asset-manifest
  checks, browser paths, and console checks. The current 390x844 local Home also
  boots with one Pixi canvas.
- Problems / risks: P0-B Pixi sizing can place the live companion outside the
  focal zone in constrained or letterboxed hosts. P0-A opening commitment is
  incomplete because new saves unlock all runtime-ready companions. First-habitat
  cross-device QA is not signed off on this branch.
- Next safe action: Open a separate approved GROUNDWORK TASK_PACK for P0-B
  root-bounds sizing before expanding gameplay or systems.
- Required reading: `docs/qa/NEXUS_LINK_RUNTIME_AUDIT_2026-06-24.md`,
  `docs/architecture/RUNTIME_MAP.md`, `docs/testing/MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`,
  `ACCEPTANCE.md`.

## Lane 2 - Game Art, UI, And Visual Production

### 2026-06-24 - Codex - Aurora B visual parity baseline

- Status: `VERIFIED`
- Branch / commit: `codex/ui-v2-aurora-parity` / `3c91291`
- Scope: DOM HUD, Bottom Nav, Soul Talk drawer, Settings, onboarding surfaces,
  and the live Pixi scene boundary. No companion asset or renderer rewrite.
- Work performed: Completed Aurora B parity packs 1 through 8, including the
  five-zone navigation, compact Soul Talk strip and drawer, settings controls,
  and mobile visual treatment.
- Verification: The local 390x844 Home renders the Aurora HUD over one live
  Pixi canvas. The companion remains a scene entity rather than baked UI art.
- Problems / risks: Visual parity does not solve the P0-B constrained-viewport
  companion-placement issue. The current asset pipeline contains historical
  64x64 instructions that conflict with the current illustrated 512x512
  companion policy; use the animation catalog and `AGENTS.md` as the newer
  standard.
- Next safe action: After P0-B is resolved, run the first-habitat visual QA on
  390x844, desktop, and a letterboxed host before accepting additional UI work.
- Required reading: `docs/ui/NEXUS_LINK_UI_V2_HANDOFF.md`,
  `docs/qa/NEXUS_LINK_RUNTIME_AUDIT_2026-06-24.md`,
  `docs/assets/COMPANION_ANIMATION_CATALOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`.

## Lane 3 - Raphael Core, Companion Reasoning, And Soul Talk

### 2026-06-25 - Codex - Raphael × Aurora UI v2 integration pack 1

- Status: `VERIFIED`
- Branch / commit: `integrate/ui-v2-raphael-main` / `7ff11a4` base, uncommitted scoped integration
- Scope: Selective Aurora shell, HUD, five-zone navigation, Soul Talk strip, and drawer port. No source-branch merge or RaphaelCore change.
- Work performed: Added Aurora-only CSS layers and DOM structure; added Home navigation and persistent-nav behavior; added Soul Talk drawer name, collapse state, and mobile viewport focus handling. Preserved the main Raphael message pipeline and quick-reply DOM.
- Changed files: `index.html`, Aurora CSS files under `styles/`, `src/ui/actionSheetController.js`, `src/ui/panelManager.js`, `src/ui/soulTalkController.js`, local preview and future-prototype/packaging documents, and this ledger entry.
- Verification: `git diff --check`; bundled Node `--check` for all changed JavaScript; local browser on port 8765 at 390×844, 393×852, 430×932, and 1280×800; one canvas, five nav items, non-overlapping strip/nav, drawer open/close, typed Raphael response, quick-reply Raphael response, and zero console errors.
- Problems / risks: The existing P0-B constrained-viewport Pixi companion focal-zone issue remains outside this package; UI work is not a renderer fix or release sign-off. Full settings/onboarding and `nexuslink_v2` persistence were intentionally deferred.
- Not touched: `src/ai/**`, `src/state/**`, Pixi renderer, assets, tools, scripts, UI locale, settings/onboarding controllers, source UI handoff/audit documents, and QA output files.
- Next safe action: Human review of the scoped diff, then a separate approved P0-B renderer-sizing package before release-level UI acceptance.
- Required reading: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ACCEPTANCE.md`, `docs/handoff/RAPHAEL_AI_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/dev/LOCAL_PREVIEW.md`, and this lane.

### 2026-06-24 - Codex - Raphael integration reconciliation audit

- Status: `BLOCKED`
- Branch / commit: `codex/ui-v2-aurora-parity` / `e0a06d6`; canonical remote
  `origin/main` / `5eb33fb`
- Scope: Compared the checked-out runtime, current remote main, the Stage 4
  feature branch, and GitHub Pages. No Raphael code was copied, merged, or
  modified.
- Work performed: Confirmed this worktree has no `src/ai/**` Raphael runtime
  modules. Its Soul Talk uses the local emotion engine and `soulTalkComposer`
  response packs. Confirmed `origin/main` contains RaphaelCore, wires it into
  Soul Talk, and has a post-PR #87 sign-off at `5eb33fb`.
- Verification: The current local 390x844 runtime has no Raphael module import,
  no Raphael globals, and no quick-reply chips. GitHub Pages boots with one
  Pixi canvas, exposes the Soul Talk quick-reply region after a message, returned
  a local Raphael reply for `today is tiring`, and reported zero console errors.
- Problems / risks: `origin/main` is not an ancestor of this branch, so Raphael
  is deployed on canonical main but is not integrated into this UI branch. The
  Raphael handoff also names a different checkout as its active workspace and
  identifies this checkout as prone to divergence. Treat that as a repository
  reconciliation issue, not permission to overwrite this user-directed branch.
  The
  Raphael Constitution is local-first, but remote Raphael code includes optional
  external gateway and provider-adapter scaffolding. No live external call was
  verified; the scaffolding still needs a no-LLM/no-backend policy review before
  any reconciliation merge. The root Master Canon still describes Raphael as
  DRAFT and unintegrated, so its implementation-status wording requires a
  separately approved documentation sync.
- Next safe action: Create a dedicated Raphael reconciliation TASK_PACK. Select
  the local-only baseline, exclude external gateway/provider code, map state and
  UI changes, and request GROUNDWORK approval before integrating it here.
- Required reading: `docs/raphael/RAPHAEL_CONSTITUTION.md`,
  `NEXUS_LINK_MASTER_CANON_v3.1.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and after `git fetch`,
  `origin/main:docs/handoff/RAPHAEL_AI_HANDOFF.md`,
  `origin/main:docs/architecture/RAPHAEL_CORE_JS_V1.md`,
  `origin/main:docs/architecture/RAPHAEL_SOUL_ARCHITECTURE_V1.md`,
  `origin/main:docs/qa/RAPHAEL_CORE_JS_V1_TEST_RUNS.md`.
